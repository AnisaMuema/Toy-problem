TOY PROBLEM PREREQUISITES!

Project description

Welcome to my project. This is my very first javascript-based project. Toy problem prerequisites consist of three mini projects that helped me put the javascript content I learned into practice. 

"Students Grade Generator", prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between between 0 and 100.

"Speed Detector", takes the speed of a car as input e.g. 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.

"Net Salary Calculator", is  a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.

-----INSTRUCTIONS------
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 
<!-- NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution. -->

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. For the first challenge, Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

4. For the second challenge, Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    >For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

5. For the last challenge, Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee
